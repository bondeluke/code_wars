(CodeWars)[https://www.codewars.com/] is an online platform designed to enhance users' coding abilities through the completion of coding challenges (known as "kata").

As I learn the (Rust programming language)[https://www.rust-lang.org/], I'm using this repository to document my solutions and track my progress as I practice my Rust programming skills.
