## Rust & Code Wars
I'm learning the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and I'm using this repository to document my solutions and track my progress as I practice my Rust programming skills.

[CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) is an online platform designed to enhance users' coding abilities through the completion of coding challenges, known as "kata". These challenges are divided into difficulty levels represented by "kyu" rankings, similar to martial arts belts. The lower the kyu number, the higher the difficulty level.
- Kata: The name for a programming challenge on Code Wars.
- Kyu: The difficulty level of a Kata. The lower the kyu number, the higher the difficulty level.

## Completed Kata
Here are the Kata I've completed so far, grouped by its kyu ranking. Each link will take you to my source code, which includes the problem description, my solution, and associated unit tests.
